Search comprehensively for {substance_name} regulatory information from these four mandatory sources:

1. EPAR (European Public Assessment Reports): https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/search?f%5B0%5D=ema_medicine_bundle%3Aema_medicine&f%5B1%5D=ema_search_categories%3A83
2. EMA-PSBG (Product-Specific Bioequivalence Guidance): https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory-overview/research-development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/product-specific-bioequivalence-guidance
3. FDA-Approvals: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/
4. FDA-PSBG: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/psg/index.cfm

1. All relevant regulatory documents found (with direct PDF links when available)
2. Comprehensive approval status and dates from EMA and FDA
3. Key regulatory information about the substance
4. EMA-PSBG bioequivalence guidance documents - IMPORTANT: The EMA-PSBG page contains a list of over 50 substances with specific bioequivalence guidance. Look for "{substance_name}" in both "Draft guidelines under consultation" and "Finalised guidelines" sections. If found, provide the direct PDF link.

- The EMA-PSBG page has alphabetically organized guidance documents
- Search for exact matches and similar names (e.g., "{substance_name}" might be listed under generic or brand names)
- If no specific guidance is found, explicitly state "No product-specific bioequivalence guidance found for {substance_name}"
- Include any related substances or similar chemical entities that have guidance

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear sections for each source (EPAR, EMA-PSBG, FDA-Approvals, FDA-PSBG)
- Include ALL source URLs for verification
- For clinical trials: Provide NCT numbers, study phases, primary endpoints, and outcomes
- For EMA-PSBG: If guidance found, provide direct PDF link; if not found, state explicitly
